## Routes constructor for Yandex maps - based by NexusDeveloper Class-style version - Thanks!

See base repo on [GitHub Pages](https://nexusdeveloper.github.io/Routes-constructor-for-Yandex-map/gh-pages/).\

I clone it for education purpose only, author is NexusDeveloper.\
!!! This repo is private, but GitHub reject this status for Russian-located users.\

### Function-style version by ZarNizza

For Drug/Sort feature used another library: https://github.com/SortableJS/react-sortablejs by waynevanson

At RCMapF.js string ref changed to React ref.
