## Routes constructor for Yandex maps

based on NexusDeveloper class-style version - Thanks!\

Base repo on [GitHub Pages](https://nexusdeveloper.github.io/Routes-constructor-for-Yandex-map/gh-pages/).\

I clone it for education purpose only, author is NexusDeveloper.\
!!! The repo is private, but GitHub reject this status for Russian-located users.\

### Function-style version

For Drag/Sort feature used another library: https://github.com/SortableJS/react-sortablejs by <code>waynevanson</code>

In RCMapFunc.js string ref changed to React ref.

ToDo: refactor RCMap at function-style, apply testing, write user manual
